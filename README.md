# Gilbert's Local Weather App

Imagine you could visit a website and find out what the weather was like in your area?
And imagine you never again left home uninformed about the day's elements? And you always
knew to wear two cozy layers of wool socks because it's snowing fluffy baseballs outside?
Or to snatch your hella umbrella because it's raining?

Gilbert's Local Weather App is the solution to your problem because it tells you
the weather in your local area. Visit [Gilbert's Local Weather App](https://codepen.io/gilbertginsberg/pen/oYazoV),
and know the weather in a snap.
